# Solving Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithms

The aim of the project is to evaluate and to improve a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling
Salesman Problem using the Genetic Algorithms Matlab Toolbox, to experiment with various repre-
sentations, genetic operators and parameters, and to report on the results.

The guidelines of the project and our final report are made available.
